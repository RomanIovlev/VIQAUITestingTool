VIQAUITestingTool
=================

This is an agile Framework for Web UI testing. It based on VI (Virtual Intelligence) concept which provides with fully ready for use tools from one side, but also gives you an ability to "re-learn" tool for using any of the actions.
1. Framework based on WebDriver (Selenium 2.X)
2. Language is C# but other languages comming soon
3. Used popular in WebDriver Community model - PageObjects and extended with new features
4. VIQA works with clear for understand HTML objects, instead of WebElemnt, with lots of abilities for tuning work with them (logging, learning, assering intercepting and other)
